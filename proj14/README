Proj 14
Jeff Gensler

This project simulates a series of airports (nodes) and the flights that
connect this airports. The graph is directed.

commands include:
  q -- quit
  t <int> <int> -- can travel 
  r <int> -- delete all nodes and resize
  i <int> <int> -- insert an edge
  d <int> <int> -- delete and edge
  l -- list the edges
  [unimplemented] f -- execute file with these commands (except file)

building:
  $ make -f proj14_make build
running:  
  $ ./a.out

notes:
  I have enabled my DFS algorithm to encouter cycles (because technically 
  the cyclic flights don't inhibit traveling from A to B to C ...)
  I also have left out the case where if you leave X to go to X, you will
  always make it, even if the edge to itself is not present.
